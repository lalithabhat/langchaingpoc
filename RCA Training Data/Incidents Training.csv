After further investigation it was found that due to a sm cubeall leak from cube the hydraulic oil line approxim cubeately 100 m cubel of oil was spilled in the shell door. The leak was internal and no oil went overboard. The cause of the leak is due to the defective fitting on the hydraulic oil line.

The Solid Particle Trap and m cubeagnetic trap were cleaned before being put back in service. TO EO and HD were present for the inspection. The presence of non-food item cubes is believed to be due to corrosion som cubeewhere along the food waste system cube and not due to a lack of proper food waste segregation. The ship's vibrations could also be the root cause of the nuts and screws being found in the m cubeagnetic trap as they shake and com cubee loose.  Dir of Env Com cubepliance POD and other shipboard personnel have been notified about the results of the inspection. Entry was m cubeade in the NAPA log to report the near-m cubeiss incident.

On Novem cubeber 21st 2020 at 08:57 while the ship was underway in Baham cubeas territorial water the turbidity differential com cubepliance param cubeeter on DG4 went above the com cubepliant lim cubeit (25 FNU) for 93 m cubeinutes. However since the ship went outbound the Baham cubeas baseline at 10:00 only 63 m cubeinutes were non-com cubepliant in the Baham cubeas. The incident occurred during increased engine load and the changeover operation from cube HSFO to m cubeGO. Initially the high turbidity was caused by soot released by the higher load but then it kept going as m cubeGO started to circulate in the fuel system cube. The SO2/CO2 ratio went down and so did the Sea Water flow resulting in a consequent increase of the turbidity due to the higher load and soot detaching from cube the exhaust gas m cubeanifold. THE OOWs cleaned the Turbidity m cubeeter on AAQS 4 three tim cubees as troubleshooting before they noticed a decrease in the SeaWater flow. They m cubeanually started increasing the Sea Water flow until they saw an im cubeprovem cubeent and eventually the turbidity differential slowly went back below 25 FNU. Since this was a som cubeewhat 'new' experience for the team cube they have learned from cube it and as a preventative m cubeeasure in the future if there is a changeover from cube HSFO to m cubeGO with a high engine load they will anticipate high turbidity and begin the m cubeanual increase of the Sea Water flow prior to the fuel changeover.
